# Raka's Cookbook

This is my cookbook - a collection of recipes for various languages and various Use Cases. Things I want to look at in each programming language to truly be able to use it:

* General Programming Language stuff
    * String Operations
    * Functional Programming
    * Error Handling
    * Meta-Programming
* File Operations
    * Existence check
    * read/write/append/delete
    * Handling of file descriptors
* Memory Handling
    * Dynamic Memory Allocation / Memory Management / Garbage Collector
* Systems Programming / Network Stuff
    * Command Line argument parsing
    * Socket Programming
    * Simple TCP Server
    * Signal Handling
    * Process/Subprocess
    * Multithreading
* Ecosystem-Related Stuff
    * Common Formatter / Linter
    * Build System
    * Package Manager / Index
    * Testing Frameworks

Of course, the list of what you can do with a programming language can be quite extensive. And sometimes, for a language like Python, I might be more interested in it's syntactical sugar / datascience features compared to C++, where I'm more interested in systems programming features.

Each language will be contained within a folder. The `README.md` in each folder shall cover quick overviews or link to sources that give clarity on how the language handles the topic listed above.

The list above is also helpful for me _(and maybe whoever reads this)_ to get started with any programming language. I think, if we know each aspect of the list above in a programming language, then we can make meaningful projects with it.
